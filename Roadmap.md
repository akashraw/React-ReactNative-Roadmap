# React/React-Native Roadmap

This React/React-Native roadmap guides you through learning how to build web applications using React, starting from core JavaScript/Typescript concepts and foundational React features. You’ll master JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle methods, before progressing to advanced topics such as hooks, routing, state management with libraries like Redux or Zustand, and performance optimization. As you gain confidence, you’ll also explore testing, TypeScript and the full deployment pipeline for production-ready web apps. And in React native we will dive deeper into navigation, state management, animations, and accessing device APIs. As you advance, the roadmap touches on performance optimization and native module integration.
